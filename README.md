# Data Science Real-Life Example

This is an real life example of data science applied at the workplace. In this example we will go over

## Getting Started

1. Do you have a local development environment for python or R?
 * Yes, continue on!
 * If not, sign up for [Cloud9](https://c9.io) for a dev environment in the cloud (R not supported)
2. Are you familiar with git (version control)?
 * Yes, then run the following command to clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mcdonnez/data-science-example.git
```
 * No, then you should learn git. till then go ahead and download the code from [github](https://github.com/mcdonnez/data-science-example) as a zip file
 * If you haven't used git and want to learn here is a [great tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
3. Run the following command to install library (duration ~15 minutes)
* For Python
```
sudo pip install requirements.txt
```
* For R
```

```

## Project Description

## Other Projects to Try

Here is a [list of data sets](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/17-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/) to try out your data science skills.

Also if you want to practice more I recommend using [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) They host competitions with real life data sets that you can try your skills at.

## TODO

Project initially built for the Data Science U Club

Goals:
* Real life problem with data science

Parameters:
* Some but not all have experience coding/scripting
* 1 hour
* Workshop with a dataset and python and R scripts

TODO:
* Select a Dataset
* Select an analysis to perform
* Write a Python script that does the hard stuff
* Set out with a couple more improvements to perform on the dataset
